### <i>A MERN Application</i>

## 1. About
#### Purpose:
Each year, approximately 30,000 people are reported missing in Australia - that's one person every 18 minutes[^1]. Unfortunately, not all of these cases are exposed to the public in timely manner, if at all. The more people who are aware of a recently missing person, the greater the likelihood is of finding them. 

The purpose of this website is to provide a platform for both members of the general public and law enforcement to post and share information about missing persons in NSW. Allowing members of the public to engage with reports and share details via social media about missing persons will increase the chances of locating the missing individuals by engaging a wider network of individuals and therefore decreasing the amount of time it takes to distribute key information.

Using this site will hopefully assist in reuniting families, bringing closure to loved ones, and raising awareness about cases in NSW. Every effort in the search counts and matters, and as a community using this site, we can do our part to help.
