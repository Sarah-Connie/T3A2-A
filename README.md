# Hope Hunters: A Missing Persons Aggregate Site
### <i>A MERN Application</i>

---
# Documentation

## 1. About
### Purpose
Each year, approximately 30,000 people are reported missing in Australia - that's one person every 18 minutes[^1]. Unfortunately, not all of these cases are exposed to the public in timely manner, if at all. The more people who are aware of a recently missing person, the greater the likelihood is of finding them. 

The purpose of this website is to provide a platform for both members of the general public and law enforcement to post and share information about missing persons in NSW. Allowing members of the public to engage with reports and share details via social media about missing persons will increase the chances of locating the missing individuals by engaging a wider network of individuals and therefore decreasing the amount of time it takes to distribute key information.

Using this site will hopefully assist in reuniting families, bringing closure to loved ones, and raising awareness about cases in NSW. Every effort in the search counts and matters, and as a community using this site, we can do our part to help.

### Functionality
Users will be able to login using their email and password and access their Hope Hunters account. From their account, a user has the ability to then create a new missing persons "file", update/delete any files they've created, or update/delete their account.

Law enforcement and admin will also be able to login with their credentials and 
achieve the same functionality. However, admin and law enforcement accounts have the ability to update or delete any missing persons "file" regardless of who created it. Additionally, admin accounts are able to retrieve information of all accounts, including police accounts.

Any member of the public will be able to use the site. Public members who do not have a Hope Hunter account will be able to view-only all missing persons files. Hope Hunters will have a search/filtration system which will allow users to filter the results by:
- Location a-z
- Name a-z
- Age ascending/descending
- Date Posted (chronological as default, newest first)

or search results by model fields:
- Location
- Name
- Police District
- Amber Alert
- Age
- Gender 
- Area suspected to be
- Last seen (postcode)
<!-- - ?Race  -->

### Target Audience
The target audience for this site as briefly explained above, is the general public. With police busy with major crimes across different sectors and far too many annual missing person cases being filed, this site aims to enlist the assistance and knowledge from the general public.

In today's interconnected digital world, there lies strength in numbers. The power and gravity of collective action is important to understand in this context. With social media acting as a catalyst, the swift dissemination of information is made much easier and is hopefully able to play a crucial role in assisting someone's safe return home. Additionally, having direct access to sharing a 'file' onto social media may be a lifesaver, as you may not know the person but an old friend of yours is now friends with that person's parent - you never know how many connections away you are from either the missing person directly or atleast someone who may have information. 

Our goal is to minimize the delay in information reaching the public as well as help law enforcement pool together every possible avenue of potential connection to better help locate a missing person.
